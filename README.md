### Requirements:
* 3D printer
* PLA filament
* 120mm PC fan rated at 12V
* 12V adapter
* 120mm activated carbon filter

### Steps:
1. Print the parts given (.3mf 3D files available in this repo) using PLA.
2. Set print settings as 0.2mm 2 wall, 15% infill.
3. Put the filter inside the case first.
4. Then put the divider and then put the fan.
5. Then put the base through the fan holes and screw the base in front.
6. Connect 12V adapter to the PC fan. 12V for max speed greater than 12V will burn the fan and less than 12V won't be effective.
